1. What is a nested loop?
a nested loop is a loop within the body of another loop.

2. Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: while loops or for loops?
while loops are based on a conditional statement.

3. When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a while loop or a
for loop?
you would use a while loop

4. Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?

sammy = 'Sammy'

for letter in sammy:
	print(letter)

5. Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a for loop be nested inside a
while loop? Why or why not?
yes a for loop can be nested within a while loop. the nested for loop will run for each iteration of the outer while loop. 

example: Perfect Number:

a = 1
while a <= 100:
	y_sum  = 0

	for i in range(1, a):
		if a % i == 0:
			y_sum = y_sum + i
	if y_sum == a:
		print('Perfect Number:', a)
	a = a + 1

output:

Perfect Number: 6
Perfect Number: 28
